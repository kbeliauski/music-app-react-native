const AnimatedSFSymbol = Animated.createAnimatedComponent(SFSymbol);

<AnimatedSFSymbol
  name="sun.min.fill"
  style={{
    opacity: new Animated.Value(1),
  }}
/>;
```

## Props

### name

The symbol name you want to display, can be seen in the SF Symbols application.

## color

The color of the symbol written as a hex or color value.

### weight

The (font) weight of the symbol. Light, regular, medium, bold, etc.

The scale of the symbol, it will optimise the thickness of detail strokes in the icon for different sizes. Currently small, medium and large.
